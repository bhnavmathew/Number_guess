# Number_guess
This is a basic game I developed using python through a Udemy course.
So the game is basically a number guessing game.
There are two types of levels
easy and hard.
using for loop you get the numbers from user until the number generated by the compiler is equal to the number given by the user.
The easy level allows user to input 10 numbers and hard level gives only 5 numbers to input.
using a while loop the code is executed
